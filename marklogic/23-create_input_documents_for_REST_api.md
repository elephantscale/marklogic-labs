# Create input documents for REST api

## To create the input documents used by the walkthrough:

* Create a text file named one.xml with the following contents

    ```
    <one>
        <child>The noble Brutus has told Caesar was ambitious</child>
    </one>
    ```

* Create a text file named two.json with the following contents:

    ```
    {
        "two": {
            "child": "I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him."
        }
    }
    ```
